[TSA App](https://kylestiers.shinyapps.io/TSAapp/)

Tool for parsing ouput of a TSA experiment on a QS3 instrument and immediate analysis of experimental results with some on-the-fly control over plotting and view for basic figure generation.

Exported "Melt Curve Raw Data" from QS3 is directly supported as xls(x).

A quick example of how on the fly editing works:
